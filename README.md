# Tolstoi: Copilot for mind

Tolstoi is a tool that helps you think better. It uses your journals to learn about you and acts as a trusted advisor when you make new entries in your journal. 

Features:
* Check if your thoughts today align with your long-term values.
* Point out if you're stuck on the same though.
* Make sure you don't fall for cognitive biases.

Note: Tolstoi is a quick weekend project that I made for myself. While it is fun to play with, it is far from being fully reliable for now. 

If you are interested in making it better, let me know!
